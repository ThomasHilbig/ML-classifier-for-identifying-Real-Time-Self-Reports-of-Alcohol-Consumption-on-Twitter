# ML-classifier-for-identifying-Real-Time-Self-Reports-of-Alcohol-Consumption-on-Twitter

This algorithm was produced in line with the dissertation "Exploring Data Mining Techniques for Social Science: Identifying Real-Time, Self-Reports of Alcohol Consumption" written by Thomas Hilbig as partial fulfilment of the requirement's for the Master's degree "Social Research Methods".

This dissertation will be made open-source in due course to give the full context of the classifier, including its affordances and limitations.

If anyone wishes to use this algorithm, please reference this github page until such a point where the dissertation will be publically available. 




Much of this algorithm is based on research conducted by Katti (2016).
